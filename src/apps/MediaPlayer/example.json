Founded in ‚Äò99 by Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning, the new album features 17 players including original members Emily Haines and Jimmy Shaw of Metric, Amy Millan and Evan Cranley of Stars, Charles Spearin and Ohad Benchetrit of Do Make Say Think, and Grammy-nominated Leslie Feist. \n\nHug Of Thunder is everything BSS fans love from the Canadian collective and then some, an album overflowing with glorious open chords, multi-voice harmonies, spacious psychedelia-tinted breakdowns, and more. It is a panoramic, expansive album that manages to be both epic and intimate; and like all things BSS, in troubled times, it offers a serotonin rush of positivity. Since their inception in the early Aughts, BSS have always pushed sonic boundaries while remaining reverent of a perfect chorus; almost twenty years down the line, Hug Of Thunder sharpens that balance and then some. The record‚Äôs twelve songs refract the band‚Äôs varying emotions, methods, and techniques in ways that not only reference their other albums, but surpass them. Hug Of Thunder is righteous but warm, angry but loving, melodic but uncompromising. And if you‚Äôve ever fallen in love with Broken Social Scene - as many of us have - it is a perfect return that was truly worth the wait.",

The first release 'Upside Down, Inside Out' combines the eccentricities of 1970's new wave with the boldness of modern experimental pop, and was recorded with local producer Sean Cook (Big Scary, Velociraptor)",

(Chk Chk Chk)‚Äôs new video for ‚ÄòDancing Is The Best Revenge‚Äô, taken from ‚ÄòShake The Shudder‚Äô, out May 19th on Warp Records.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we recorded Dancing Is The Best Revenge I pitched up my voice, becoming Nicole Fayu in the studio - much like Prince became Camille and Morrissey became Ann Coates. the groove felt like a strut or walk and i imagined it akin to drag or ballroom culture.\n\nAfter The One 2 video featured such strong dance performances, and was filmed in the historic LA venue Jalisco, we decided to give the song to some girls who could really walk the walk and perform the song as in the spirit of reinvention. We traded some outfits and makeup tips and they helped me become IRL Nicole Fayu. Dancing with them was a blast, and it was great to finally see the song walked. I have to admit, I'm not used to being out performed in a video.\n\nThese ladies ignore a world that tells them who they should be - they take the stage, walking as whoever they want to be, and that‚Äôs their best revenge. Maybe you‚Äôll never put on heels, maybe you'll never walk onstage, maybe you‚Äôll never be anyone else, but maybe this song/vid/story inspires you to try something you haven't before.‚Äù‚ÄîNic Offer\n\nPreorder ‚ÄòShake The Shudder‚Äô ‚Äì http://smarturl.it/shake-shudder\nStream ‚ÄòDancing Is The Best Revenge‚Äô ‚Äì http://smarturl.it/ditbr-stream\n\nCast:\nNic Offer\nKamryn Moore-Fierce\nNikki Moore\nMakena Moore\nPhoebe Monroe DeLa Strawberry\n\nCrew:\nDirector - Will Galperin\nProducer - Kyle Thompson\nDirector of Photography - Jonathan Michael Mahoney\nCamera Operator - Jose Babcock\n1st AC / Camera Operator - Adam Niva\nProduction Assistant / Camera Operator - Michael Lipton\nProduction Assistant - Ben Graham Smith\nEditor - Kyle Thompson\nLocation Manager - Sergio Hernandez\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/UJuQ5i",

Is the nightlife as we know it truly a soulful experience? Or are we just running away from time instead of with it? Can we be saved from the monotony of daylight mediocrity through love and beauty in the night?

Hooray! i'd like to show, to all the folk i know, who go in droves to visit with the meek.\nI peak, I peak when cracks were sleek, and i can't get to sleep; I laugh and weep and I wonder why I'm weak.\n\nI'll be out in the back, I'll be out, I'll be out.\n\nI grope, I grope the sloppy slope and its the only hope the Hangman's rope will never leave my hand.\nI lean, I lean on walls and beams to help my self esteem and build a team that helps me when I stand.\nI gaze a gaze of true dismay, but you are not my prey, its just a trait of the spirit i got left.\nno more, no more I beg you for, your eyes the seem to bore, my brain adores the things that you posses.\n\nI'll be out in the back, I'll be out, I'll be out.\n\nI play, I played the razor game, and it was sharp and drained what I contained before the thunder came.\n\nI'll be out in the back, I'll be out, I'll be out.",

        "description": "Preorder the new album on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/JFHitch\nListen and follow on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/TLTOMM_Stream\n\nPremiere on The Guardian UK with article by Ritzy below ; \n\nThe Last Thing on My Mind was written and recorded in the summer of 2014 at our North Walian studio the Red Brick, just outside of Mold in Clwyd. It has the feel and sentiment of a lot of the tracks from our new album, it talks about feeling alive, being free and this track in particular touches upon sexual liberation; specifically about a woman's carnal imagination. \nWe're big on making our own music videos, so last month we started collecting footage & finishing the treatment to this song.\nThe video follows a voyeuristic heterosexual female gaze (like my own) watching men in all forms, free, relaxed, sexy and objectified . It's beautiful, provocative, occasionally pervy , sometimes just admiring the prowess of Hendrix and his guitar or Iggy's gorgeous lack of inhibitions. \nI'm writing this piece as the frontwoman of The Joy Formidable, but the intent behind this video was formed as a group, with both my male band members. I think that's important to mention because what fueled this treatment was something that we'd all been feeling; that there just isn't enough diversity in music videos when it comes to sexual representation. \nThe male gaze is well represented, we see plenty of female nudity, statistically more than men, we see men in positions of power with scantily clad women, and we see female protagonists mirroring that power dynamic with overt sexual aggression. \nThis obsession with who is sexually in control is negative for both sexes. The implication that all men are aggressive and that women need to compete in the same way isn't the road to equality. \nIn music videos what we don't see very often is men and women equal in their nudity and sensual without a power struggle. \nIt's a lot to cover in one music video; but showing a different side of male sensuality is one part of the conversation. It was actually very difficult finding footage to this aim. At one point whilst typing in \"female gaze\" to a search engine, the results were some camera shots of a woman's behind . I guess what I'm trying to convey is whilst making this video we kept finding proof of the imbalance, of the ingrained gender stereotypes, it was difficult finding footage that showed men sexualised, sensual or vulnerable from a female perspective that mirrored my own. \nWe all have the freedom to do what we like with our bodies and our sexuality (as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else), and we don't condone objectification in general, the point here is, when the media representation is imbalanced,if we're mostly seeing women sexualised or objectified, from a male perspective or otherwise, it's limited, it's damaging and frankly; it's boring too. \nI'd like to see even more diversity please, in music videos and the way that sex is represented in general. Censorship is changing with the Internet and the way that music videos are reaching people, we're socially becoming more accustomed to explicit material. If that's what society has decided lets see more bulges, more condoms, labia, different body types, pubic hair, even the long vilified erection is fine by me , everything presented equally with less taboo so that diversity is accepted.\n\n\n\nNew album 'Hitch' out March 25, 2016\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thejoyformidable\nhttps://www.twitter.com/joyformidable\nhttps://www.instagram.com/joyformidable",

For two years, they devoted their days to constructing their dream studio and spent their nights performing songs by The Police, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local pubs to pay the bills. \"We really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,\" recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius's vocalist/guitarist. \"We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,\" adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. The studio was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called \"Trojans,\" which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls. Within an hour, \"Trojans\" was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide.\n\nQuickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, \"Trojans\" reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio's Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, \"Trojans\" was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. \"Trojans\" began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.\n\nThe band's first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour. The tour started in August 2012 and led to three more tours back to back taking them thru to the end of the year. Thus, their full-length debut was finished up between tour dates and got completed just before Christmas 2012. When It Was Now is set for a US release on February 19th, 2013, with an international release to follow soon after.",
