    This was going to be a longer post but I thought this was interesting enough
    to post now.

    <a
      href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle"
      >React</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram">Vue</a>
    both have fairly well defined lifecycle events which we can use to
    successfully navigate the mysteries of the virtual DOM.
  </p>
  <p>
    So without further ado, let‚Äôs get down to the React vs Vue lifecycle events
    smackdown!

  </h2>
  <p>
    The following demo logs out the Vue lifecycle events when a component mounts
    and updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs actually a fairly nice API in that everything is consistently named,
    even if not all of the events are strictly useful.

    React is actually the more esoteric of the two in terms of naming, but
    actually offers more powerful functionality (such as my particular
    favourite, <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>).

  <p>The basic workflow for a component is pre-mount ‚Üí render ‚Üí mount.</p>
  <p>
    Vue has more events, whereas React is more Javascripty with an actual ES
    constructor.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>React</th>
        <th>Vue</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>constructor</td>
        <td>beforeCreate</td>
        <td>
          Roughly synonymous with each other. The constructor sets up the React
          class, whereas Vue handles the class creation for you.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>data</td>
        <td>
          Set data. Vue recursively converts these properties into
          getter/setters to make them ‚Äúreactive‚Äù.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>created</td>
        <td>
          Data observation, computed properties, methods, watch/event callbacks
          have been set up.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>beforeMount</td>
        <td>
          Right before the mounting begins: the render function is about to be
          called for the first time.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>getDerivedStateFromProps</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>
          Invoked right before calling the render method. It should return an
          object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>render</td>
        <td>render</td>
        <td>The virtual DOM is rendered and inserted into the actual DOM.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>componentDidMount</td>
        <td>mounted</td>
        <td>
          The component is now mounted. We can make any direct DOM manipulations
          at this point.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    We can see from our lifecycle that the perfect time to hook into the process
    is once the component has been mounted (in React‚Äôs
    <code>componentDidMount</code> or Vue‚Äôs <code>mounted</code> event).

    Component update generally follows a pre-update ‚Üí render ‚Üí updated workflow.
    Easy!

    When your component is removed from the page, sometimes you need to remove
    event handlers or clean up after any manual DOM manipulation.

        <td>
          When using
          <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#keep-alive">Vue keep-alive</a>, the
          component is removed from the page but not destroyed so that we can
          load it again later without the overhead of component mount.

      </tr>

  </h2>
  <p>
    This is something I‚Äôve not looked too much into, but it‚Äôs possible to catch
    errors from child components and change the render accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    This would be most useful for a top-level component (above the routes,
    maybe) to show an ‚ÄúAw Snap‚Äù error message into your app and stop the error
    bubbling up.
  </p>

      <tr>

  </h2>
  <p>
    Each has their own benefits, neither is objectively better or worse.
    Personally I prefer the Vue naming, but prefer the power of the React API.
  </p>
  <p>
    After pulling this info together I‚Äôm really interested to try out Vue‚Äôs
    keep-alive for render-intensive jobs. It‚Äôs a cool feature I didn‚Äôt know
    existed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm also excited to play with component-level error handling, especially for
    larger apps. It makes a lot of sense to catch errors in the framework rather
    than waiting for them to bubble up to the global error handler üòÖ
  </p>
  <p>Anyway, hope this was helpful. I learned something.</p>
